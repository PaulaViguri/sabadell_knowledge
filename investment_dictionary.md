Below, we provide the second part of the investment dictionary, a description of common terms in startup investment operations. This is a small preview of some of the many contents included in the Loogic Guide 2016: the keys offered by each investment model.

Here is the first part of the investment dictionary from A to L.

- **Management Fee:** An annual fixed fee paid to the management company of the investment fund. It usually represents a percentage between 1% and 2% of the managed fund's volume.

- **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA):** An agreement by which a company protects the confidentiality of information provided to a third party within a negotiation, investment, or any other process.

- **Shareholders Agreement vs Investment Agreement:** The investment agreement and the shareholders' agreement can be included in one document or two separate documents. While the typical content of the investment agreement is to regulate the structure of the investment operation (for example, how many capital increases will be carried out, for what amounts, at what valuation, how many shares will be created, and who will assume them, among other aspects) and to record the representations and warranties of the current shareholders and the company itself, the typical content of the shareholders' agreement is to regulate the relationship between shareholders and with the company, identifying how decisions will be made in the general meeting and the board, if any; what rights each shareholder will have, what the regime for the transfer of shares will be, and how the exit of the venture capital entity will be carried out, if any.

- **Shareholders Agreement vs Bylaws:** Every company must have bylaws. The content they can have is regulated by the applicable regulations to the company (mainly, the Companies Act). Sometimes, shareholders or the company may reach agreements that cannot be included in the bylaws because the applicable regulations do not allow it. To record and regulate the agreements not transferable to the bylaws, the shareholders and the company can sign a shareholders' agreement. It should be noted that a shareholders' agreement, even if made public, is not enforceable against third parties, while the bylaws are.

- **Portfolio:** The set of companies in which an investor participates.

- **Post-money Valuation:** The value of a company's equity after financing or fund injection.

- **Private Placement:** The sale of shares to a small and specific group of investors, generally designed to avoid the requirements of public offerings and subscriptions.

This right is usually granted to minority shareholders concerning sales intended by shareholders with a substantial percentage of share capital.

- **Discount Rate:** The interest rate used to calculate the Net Present Value of a series of future cash flows.

- **Term Sheet:** A document that records the principles of agreement concerning an investment or financing operation.

- **Net Present Value:** The current value of a company, calculated by discounting the future cash flows at the company's Weighted Average Cost of Capital.
