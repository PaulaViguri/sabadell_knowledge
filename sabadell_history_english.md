**History**

On December 31, 1881, a group of 127 businessmen and traders from Sabadell (Barcelona) founded the bank with the purpose of financing the local industry and providing it with raw materials (wool and coal) under more favorable conditions. This initial phase lasted until 1907, when Banco Sabadell decided to liquidate its non-banking activities and focus on commercial banking. In 1953, to preserve the entity's independence, shareholders established a syndication pact. In 1965, the bank began its territorial expansion towards nearby towns. Ten years later, the entity opened its first office outside Catalonia, in Madrid, and in 1978 it started its international expansion with the opening of its first office in London, located in the heart of the City.
